Hogwild!
===============================================================================
This is Hogwild!, a project from the Hazy Research Group
http://hazy.cs.wisc.edu/hazy/victor/Hogwild/

Hogwild! is a new way of parallelzing incremental gradient algorithms.
This package is a template library for easily writing parallel 
incremental gradient descent (IGD) programs.


This package includes:
 - Hogwild! source files
 - Hogwild! google tests

Note that this is a template library so compiling is not necessary, the Makefile
is only used to compile to the google tests (which are optional).


Dependencies
===============================================================================
Hogwild! requires
  - The Hazy Template Library (HTL)
  - pthreads
Optional:
  - Build and running the test cases requires GoogleTests (gtest).
